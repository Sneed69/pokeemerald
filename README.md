## RoamersPlus Features

### Multiple Roamers
Allow for more than one roamer to exist at the same time.
### Unbound Roaming
An optional feature that extends roaming to all routes. Normally roamers will not visit most of the western routes.
##Terrestrial Roamers
These roamers cannot be found on water tiles and do not roam on sea routes.
### Battling Roamers
Choose whether a roamer flees or battles normally.
### Stalkers
These "roamers" will always move to your location. They leave the area after battle, but will follow you to the next area. Stalkers are not shown on the Pokedex by default.
### Respawning Roamers
Select one of four respawning modes: no respawn, daily, weekly or instant respawn. Respawning roamers will not stop existing until they are caught.
### Scaling Roamers
Setting a roamer's level to 0 will turn it into a scaling roamer. A scaling roamer's level increases based on your highest level party member and a constant modifier.
Includes an optional feature that allows roamers to evolve if they are high enough level.
Roamers will not level down or devolve if encountered with a weaker party.
